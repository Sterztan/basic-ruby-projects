# Project 1: Caesar Cipher
The Caesar cipher is a simple encryption technique that shifts each letter in a word or message by a fixed number of positions in the alphabet. This project demonstrates the use of Ruby’s #ord and #chr methods to convert characters to their ASCII values, apply the shift, and then convert them back to characters.

# Project 2: Substrings
This project defines a method that returns a hash of dictionary words found one or more times in a given string. It uses Ruby’s #scan method, which searches a string for matches to a given pattern and returns an array of all occurrences. The number of times each dictionary word appears is then counted and stored in the hash.
